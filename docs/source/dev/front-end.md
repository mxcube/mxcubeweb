# Front-end architecture

## Environment variables

Environment variables are defined in file `ui/.env`. To override them, create your own local environment file as explained in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files) â€“ e.g. `ui/.env.local` or `ui/.env.production.local`.

The following environment variables are available:

- `VITE_REDUX_LOGGER_ENABLED`: whether to log Redux actions to the browser console (disabled by default); useful if you're unable to install the [Redux devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension#installation) browser extension.

## Fetching layer

- For each back-end API called by the front-end, there is a file under `src/api/` named after that API (e.g. `beamline.js`, `login.js` ...)
- For each endpoint, there is a function in the API's front-end file dedicated to making HTTP requests to that endpoint (e.g. `fetchLoginInfo`, `sendRunBeamlineAction` ...)
  - Functions that retrieve resources are named `fetch<Something>`.
  - Functions that perform actions are named `send<DoSomething>`.
- Library [wretch](https://github.com/elbywan/wretch) is used for making HTTP requests; it is a thin wrapper around the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API>).
