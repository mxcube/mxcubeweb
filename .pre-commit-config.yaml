    hooks:

      # Equivalent to running `poetry check --lock`.
      # This checks that:
      # 1. the Poetry content of the `pyproject.toml` file is valid;
      # 2. there is a `poetry.lock` file;
      # 3. the content of `poetry.lock` is in sync with the content of `pyproject.toml`.
      - id: poetry-check
        args:
          - --lock

      # Equivalent to running `poetry lock --no-update`.
      # This syncs the `poetry.lock` file with the content of the `pyproject.toml` file.
      # This hook fails if it results in modifying `poetry.lock`.
      - id: poetry-lock
        args:
          - --no-update

  # Equivalent to running `poetry export`.
  # This exports the `poetry.lock` file to the `requirements.txt` file.
  # This hook fails if it results in modifying `requirements.txt`.
