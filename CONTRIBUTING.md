# How to contribute to mxcubeweb

Before submitting code to the repository, please read these contribution guidelines.
The aim of these guidelines is to help the developer community to maintain the code stable and reusable.


## Reporting bugs

Before submitting a new bug report,
check if the bug has already been reported
in the [issues](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubeweb/issues/).
If it has not been reported yet, then:

- Open a new issue with a short description in the title.

- In the description, describe the bug:

  - Conditions when the bug appears.

  - How it can be reproduced.

  - Possible cause of the bug and source code where it occurs.

  - If possible, add an error log and a screenshot.

- Assign a label to the issue (see available labels).


## Submitting code to the repository

Pull requests (PRs) are used to submit new code to the repository;
they help developers review and discuss the proposed changes.
To avoid any conflicts in the code base,
it is important to keep your local git repository synchronised
with the latest code in the upstream repository.
If the repository is checked out directly,
then use `git pull --rebase` to obtain the latest code;
if a fork is used, then add the official mxcubeweb repository to the list of remotes.

- If necessary, add a link to the official mxcubeweb repository:

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:mxcube/mxcubeweb.git
  ```

A branching model based on the popular [git-flow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is used
in order to be able to provide versioned releases and,
at the same time, continue separate development.
The stable releases are kept on the [**master**](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubeweb/tree/master) branch and,
the development takes place on [**develop**](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubeweb/tree/develop).

This means that all pull requests should be made against the [**develop**](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubeweb/tree/develop) branch. The work on the **develop** branch is performed by simply creating a branch for the work to be done and then making a PR according to the description below.

- To fetch all branches and merge upstream to your forked develop branch:

  ```bash
  git fetch --all
  git checkout develop
  git rebase upstream/develop
  ```

- If you already are working on the **develop** branch and tracking the official repository, simply:
  ```bash
  git pull --rebase develop
  ```

We **recommend to always rebase your local changes instead of merging them**, git can be configured to do this by default:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```


### Preparing a new commit

- First, make sure that you are working with the latest changes from develop

```bash
git checkout develop`
git pull --rebase develop
```

- Create a new branch. It is recommended to use a meaningful name, for instance `[initials]-[fix/feature]-[some name]`, i.e. `mo-feature-gizmo1`
  `git checkout -b mo-feature-gizmo1`
- If the pull request is associated with an issue, then reference the issue in the name. For example:
  `git checkout -b issue_100`
- Edit necessary files, delete existing or add a new file.
- Add files to the staging area:
  `git add ChangedFile1 ChangedFile2`
- Save your new commit to the local repository:
  `git commit`
- Commit command will open a text editor:
  - In the first line, write a short commit summary (maximum 50 characters). It will appear as the title of the pull request.
  - Add an empty line.
  - Write a longer description.
- Upload the content of the new branch to the remote repository:
  `git push origin NEW_BRACH_NAME`
- Go to the GitHub webpage and create a new PR.


### Creating a new pull request via GitHub webpage

- Keep the pull requests small, preferably containing a single feature or change.
- Give enough information about the changes in the pull request summary so that the reviewers easily understand what's been done.
- Highlight technically complex/complicated sections of the code and supply additional comments to code that might need extra explication/motivation by making inline comments.
- If needed, assign a developer who should review the PR.


### Accepting a pull request

- The author of a PR may request a PR review from a certain number of developers.
- A reviewer can Comment, Approve or Request changes.
- The changes made in the PR are assumed to be tested by the author
- All the assigned reviewers of a PR have to review the PR before it can be merged.
- A PR that has no reviewer assigned can be reviewed by anyone.
- The author of the PR is free to merge the PR once it has been reviewed
  and all pending comments and discussions are solved.


## Versioning

Versioning is partly automated by GitHub actions and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and is based on the git-flow branching model:

- Each new feature is implemented in a `feature branch`, branching from the `develop branch`.

- The minor version is bumped automatically by the CI workflow when a PR is merged on develop

- The merge of a `feature branch` is made via PR to the `develop branch`. The author of
  the PR must solve any conflicts with the latest development version before the merge.

- When decided, a release branch is created from the development branch and becomes
  a release candidate version.

- Once the code can be released, the release branch is merged to the `master branch` and
  also to the `develop branch`.

- If a bug is found in a released version, a `hotfix branch` is created with the
  necessary changes and applied to the `main branch` and the corresponding commits are
  also cherry-picked to the development branch.

The exact routine is described more precisely in [MEP01](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubecore/blob/develop/doc/MEPS/MEP-01/mep01.md).


## Coding convention and style guidelines

### Units

Functions returning a value representing a physical quantity should in general be associated with
a unit. It has been agreed that the following units should, where applicable, be used across the
code base:

- mm (millimetre) for translative motors and sizes
- degrees for rotative motors
- percent (%) for ratios like attenuation
- keV for energy
- K (Kelvin) for temperature
- Å (Ångström) for resolution
- Pixels are to be used for beam location (centre)
- Date time `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS(.ff)`, possibly with hundreds of seconds (ff), and with 24-hour clock.


### Type hints

We strongly encourage the usage of type hints


### Naming convention

#### Language and spelling

- UK English should be used for the spelling in documentation and code.
  Relevant examples for the mxcubeweb code base are for instance
  the words _centring_ and _characterisation_ that are the preferred spelling
  to _centering_ and _characterization_.


#### Functions

- functions names should be recognisable as actions and should generally contain a verb


#### Variables and parameters:

- names of objects and values are singular
- names of collections are plural or contain an internal 'list' (or 'tuple', 'tpl')
- names of maps are plural or contain 'map', 'dict', 'data', or an internal '2', like 'name2state'
- variables should distinguish between objects (e.g. 'motor') and their names or string representations (e.g. 'motor_name')
- Booleans can be indicated by participles (e.g. 'enabled', 'tunable') or an 'is\_' prefix. We should use positive rather than negative expressions (e.g. 'enabled' rather than 'disabled')


### Properties v. functions

- You should prefer functions ('get*', 'set*', 'update\_') when attributes are mutable and changing the value requires moving hardware or is slow or has side effects, or where you (might) need additional parameters like switches or timeout values.
  - For boolean states, prefer e.g. `set_enabled` (`True` or `False`) rather than separate `enable()` and `disable()` functions.
- You should prefer properties for simple properties or states of objects (e.g. 'name', 'user_name', 'tolerance'). Contained HardwareObjects also use properties


### Style guidelines

It is very important to write a clean and readable code.
Therefore, we follow the [PEP8 guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
Minimal required guidelines are:

- Maximum 88 characters per line.
- Use 4 spaces (not a tab) per indentation level.
- Do not use wild (star) imports.
- Used naming styles:
  - lower_case_with_underscores (snake style) for variables, methods.
  - CapitalizedWords for class names.
  - UPPERCASE for constants.
- When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare except.
- Add [google style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html?highlight=google%20style) doc strings to describe methods and classes. Types should be omitted in doc strings if the method is type hinted.

An example of how to describe a class:

```python
class ExampleClass(object):
  """The summary line for a class docstring should fit on one line.

  If the class has public attributes, they may be documented here
  in an ``Attributes`` section and follow the same formatting as a
  function's ``Args`` section. Alternatively, attributes may be documented
  inline with the attribute's declaration (see __init__ method below).

  Properties created with the ``@property`` decorator should be documented
  in the property's getter method.

  Attributes:
      attr1 (str): Description of `attr1`.
      attr2 (:obj:`int`, optional): Description of `attr2`.

  """

  def __init__(self, param1, param2, param3):
      """Example of docstring on the __init__ method.

      The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
      docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

      Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
      convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

      Note:
          Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

      Args:
          param1 (str): Description of `param1`.
          param2 (:obj:`int`, optional): Description of `param2`. Multiple
              lines are supported.
          param3 (list(str)): Description of `param3`.

      """
      self.attr1 = param1
      self.attr2 = param2
      self.attr3 = param3  #: Doc comment *inline* with attribute

      #: list(str): Doc comment *before* attribute, with type specified
      self.attr4 = ['attr4']

      self.attr5 = None
      """str: Docstring *after* attribute, with type specified."""

```

An example of how to describe a function:

```python
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2):
  """Example function with types documented in the docstring.

  `PEP 484`_ type annotations are supported. If attribute, parameter, and
  return types are annotated according to `PEP 484`_, they do not need to be
  included in the docstring:

  Args:
      param1 (int): The first parameter.
      param2 (str): The second parameter.

  Returns:
      bool: The return value. True for success, False otherwise.

  .. _PEP 484:
      https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/

  """
```

You can use [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) and [black](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) to format your code:

```bash
autopep8 -a -r -j 0 -i --max-line-length 88 ./
black --safe ./
```
